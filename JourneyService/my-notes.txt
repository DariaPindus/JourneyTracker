1. to run docker-compose, bitnami/kafka has to have permissions to the folder in modules.
    fixed by chmod -R 755 /path/to/my/folder


2. If doesn't start correctly try to clean volume folder:
    - rm -rf /data/journeytracker/kafka-persistence/
    - mkdir /data/journeytracker/kafka-persistence
    - chmod -R 777 /data/journeytracker/kafka-persistence/
